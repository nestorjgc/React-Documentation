        <p>
          React is a Javascript library that is made for building single page
          applications. React was created in 2011 by a Facebook employee and its
          purpose was to improve performance and simplify code maintenance.
          React is also an application made by components, components we can
          easily rehuse in our application to reduce code. The good thing about
          components is that they can be reused in the whole application at any
          time. Before we jump in React JS, I would highly encourage you have
          some foundation with JavaScript like:
        </p>

        <p>Some key features that I like about React:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            SPA | Single Page Application | Main benefit is that is very fast
            and the website doesn't refresh when navigating on it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Virtual DOM | It's a simplified and optimized version of the real
            DOM and it helps React to make the updates that it needs by passing
            props or states
          </li>
          <li>
            JSX | JavaScript XML It is call like that because it's a syntax
            extension to Javascript and it allows us to write HTML in
            JavaScript.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          One of the only things that I dislike about React is that is a library
          and because of that, you need to add many external libraries to make
          your application work.
        </p>

          JSX is a way to write html in our JavaScript. It is called JSX, and it
          is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React
          to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a
          template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

          React components implement a render() method that takes input data and
          returns what to display. This example uses an XML-like syntax called
          JSX. Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by
          <span class="bg__code"> render() via this.props. </span>

      <section class="main-section" id="Handling_Events">
        <header>
          <h2>Handling Events</h2>
        </header>

        <p class="components__Jsx">
          Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events
          on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:
        </p>
        <p class="components__Jsx">
          <code> For example, the HTML: </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="img/state.PNG" alt="state" class="component__img" />
        </p>

        <p class="components__Jsx">
          <code> is slightly different in React: </code>
        </p>
        <img src="img/state2.PNG" alt="state2" class="component__img" />
        <p class="components__Jsx">
          Another difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default
          behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly. For
          example, with plain HTML, to prevent the default form behavior of
          submitting, you can write:
        </p>
        <img src="img/state3.PNG" alt="state3" class="component__img" />

        <ul class="state__ul">
          <li>
            <code>
              React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>
              With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a
              string.
            </code>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Forms">
        <header>
          <h2>Forms</h2>
        </header>

        <p class="components__Jsx">
          HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in
          React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state. For
          example, this form in plain HTML accepts a <code> single name: </code>
        </p>
        <img src="img/forms.PNG" alt="forms" class="component__img" />
        <p class="components__Jsx">
          This form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page
          when the user submits the form. If you want this behavior in React, it
          just works. But in most cases, it’s convenient to have a JavaScript
          function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the
          data that the user entered into the form. The standard way to achieve
          this is with a technique called “controlled components”.
